    <string name="what_is_a_spell">
         A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping
        of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse
        into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell,
        a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of
        raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a
        particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way,
        and then releases them to unleash the desired effect - in
        most cases, all in the span of seconds.
        Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective
        wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or
        remove conditions, drain life energy
        away, and restore life to the dead.
        Uncounted thousands of spells have been created
        over the course of the multiverse\'s history, and many of
        them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in
        crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped
        in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be
        reinvented by a character who has amassed enough
        power and wisdom to do so.
    </string>

    <string name="spell_level">
        Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell\'s level is a
        general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly
        (but still impressive) <i>magic missile</i> at 1st level and
        the earth-shaking <i>wish</i> at 9th. Cantrips - simple
        but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote -
        are level 0. The higher a spell\'s level, the higher level a
        spellcaster must be to use that spell.
        \n\tSpell level and character level don\'t correspond
        directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th
        level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.
    </string>

    <string name="known_and_prepared_spells">
        Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must
        have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access
        to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes,
        including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of
        spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The
        same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other
        spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a
        process of preparing spells. This process varies for
        different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\n
        \tIn every case, the number of spells a caster can
        have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the
        character\'s level.
    </string>
    
    <string name="spell_slots">
        Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or
        prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of
        spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic
        and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is
        physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells
        are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class\'s
        description (except that of the warlock) includes a table
        showing how many spell slots of each spell level a
        character can use at each character level. For example,
        the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots
        and two 2nd-level slots.
        \n\tWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends
        a slot of that spell\'s level or higher, effectively "filling"
        a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a
        groove of a certain size - small for a 1st-level slot, larger
        for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot
        of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level
        slot. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level
        spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has
        three remaining.
        \n\tFinishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots
        (see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).
        \n\tSome characters and monsters have special abilities
        that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For
        example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four
        Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch
        invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all
        cast spells in such a way.
        \n\n<b>CASTING A SPELL AT A HIGHER LEVEL</b>
        \n\tWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a
        higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher
        level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic
        missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic
        missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill
        the slot it is put into.
        \tSome spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds,
        have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level,
        as detailed in a spell\'s description.
    </string>

    <string name="cantrips">
        A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without
        using a spell slot and without being prepared in
        advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the
        caster\'s mind and infused the caster with the magic
        needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip\'s
        spell level is O.
    </string>

    <string name="rituals">
        Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell
        can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting,
        or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of
        a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.
        It also doesn\'t expend a spell slot, which means the
        ritual version of a spell can\'t be cast at a higher level.
        \n\tTo cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a
        feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the
        druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must
        also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells
        known, unless the character\'s ritual feature specifies
        otherwise, as the wizard\'s does.
    </string>

    <string name="casting_time_info">
        Most spells require a single action to cast, but some
        spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more
        time to cast.
        \n\n<b>BONUS ACTION</b>
        \nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You
        must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell,
        provided that you haven\'t already taken a bonus action
        this turn. You can\'t cast another spell during the same
        turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.
        \n\n<b>REACTIONS</b>
        \nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells
        take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast
        in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a
        reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when
        you can do sO.
        \n\n<b>LONGER CASTING TIMES</b>
        \nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require
        more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you
        cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single
        action or reaction, you must spend your action each
        turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your
        concentration while you do so (see "Concentration"
        below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails,
        but you don\'t expend a spell slot. If you want to try
        casting the spell again, you must start over.
    </string>

    <string name="range_info">
        The target of a spell must be within the spell\'s range.
        For a spell like <i>magic missile</i>, the target is a creature.
        For a spell like <i>fireball</i>, the target is the point in space
        where the ball of fire erupts.
        \n\tMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some
        spells can target only a creature (including you) that you
        touch. Other spells. such as the shield spell, affect only
        you. These spells have a range of self.
        \n\tSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate
        from you also have a range of self, indicating that the
        origin point of the spell\'s effect must be you (see \"Areas
        of Effect\").
        \n\tOnce a spell is cast, its effects aren\'t limited by its
        range, unless the spell\'s description says otherwise.
    </string>

    <string name="components_info">
        A spell\'s components are the physical requirements you
        must meet in order to cast it. Each spell\'s description
        indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S),
        or material (M) components. If you can\'t provide one
        or more of a spell\'s components, you are unable to
        cast the spell.
        \n\n<b>VERBAL (V)</b>
        \nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The
        words themselves aren\'t the source of the spell\'s power;
        rather, the particular combination of sounds, with
        specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic
        in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area
        of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can\'t
        cast a spell with a verbal component.
        \n\n<b>SOMATIC (S)</b>
        \nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful
        gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell
        requires a somatic component, the caster must have free
        use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.
        \n\n<b>MATERIAL (M)</b>
        \nCasting some spells requires particular objects,
        specified in parentheses in the component entry.
        \nA character can use a component pouch or a
        spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place of
        the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is
        indicated for a component, a character must have that
        specific component before he or she can cast the spell.
        \n\tIf a spell states that a material component is
        consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this
        component for each casting of the spell.
        \n\tA spellcaster must have a hand free to access these
        components, but it can be the same hand that he or she
        uses to perform somatic components.
    </string>

    <string name="duration_info">
        A spell\'s duration is the length of time the spell persists.
        A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours,
        or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last
        until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.
        \n\n<b>INSTANTANEOUS</b>
        \nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms,
        heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way
        that can\'t be dispelled, because its magic exists only
        for an instant.
        \n\n<b>CONCENTRATION</b>
        \nSome spells require you to maintain concentration
        in order to keep their magic active. If you lose
        concentration, such a spell ends.
        \n\tIf a spell must be maintained with concentration,
        that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell
        specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can
        end concentration at any time (no action required).
        \n\tNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn\'t
        interfere with concentration. The following factors can
        break concentration:
        \n\n<b>&#8226; Casting another spell that requires concentration.</b>
        You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another
        spell that requires concentration. You can\'t concentrate
        on two spells at once.
        \n<b>&#8226; Taking damage.</b> Whenever you take damage while
        you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a
        Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration.
        The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take,
        whichever number is higher. If you take damage from
        multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon\'s
        breath, you make a separate saving throw for each
        source of damage.
        \n<b>&#8226; Being incapacitated or killed.</b> You lose concentration
        on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.
        \n\n\tThe DM might also decide that certain environmental
        phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while
        you\'re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed
        on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain
        concentration on a spell.
    </string>

    <string name="targets">
        A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets
        to be affected by the spell\'s magic. A spell\'s description
        tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or
        a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).
        \n\tUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature
        might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect
        like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle
        effect, such as an attempt to read a creature\'s thoughts,
        typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.
        \n\n<b>A CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGET</b>
        \nTo target something, you must have a cleor path to it,
        so it can\'t be behind total cover.
        \n\tIf you place an area of effect at a point that you can\'t
        see and an obstruction. such as a wall, is between you
        and that point, the point of origin comes into being on
        the near side of that obstruction.
        \n\n<b>TARGETING YOURSELF</b>
        \nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can
        choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or
        specifically a creature other than you. lf you are in the
        area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.
    </string>

    <string name="areas_of_effect">
        Spells such as <i>burning hands</i> and <i>cone of cold</i> cover an
        area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.
        \n\tA spell\'s description specifies its area af effect,
        which typically has ane of five different shapes: cone,
        cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has
        a <b>point of origin</b>, a location from which the spell\'s
        energy erupts. The roles for each shape specify how you position
        its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but
        some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.
        \n\tA spell\'s effect expands in straight lines from the point
        of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the
        point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that
        location isn\'t included in the spell\'s area. To block one of
        these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total
        cover.
        \n\n<b>CONE</b>
        \nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point
        of origin. A cone\'s width at a given point along its length
        is equal to that point\'s distance from the point of origin.
        A cone\'s area of effect specifies its maximum length.
        \n\tA cone\'s point of origin is not included in the cone\'s
        area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
        \n\n<b>CUBE</b>
        \nYou select a cube\'s point of origin, which lies anywhere
        on a face of the cubic effect. The cube\'s size is expressed
        as the length of each side.
        \n\tA cube\'s point of origin is not included in the cube\'s
        area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
        \n\n<b>CYLINDER</b>
        \nA cylinder\'s point of origin is the center of a circle of a
        particular radius, as given in the spell description. The
        circle must either be on the ground or at the height of
        the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in
        straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of
        the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell\'s
        effect then shoots up from the base or down from the
        top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.
        \n\tA cylinder\'s point of origin is included in the cylinder\'s
        area of effect.
        \n\n<b>LINE</b>
        \nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path
        up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.
        \n\tA line\'s point of origin is not included in the line\'s area
        of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
        \n\n<b>SPHERE</b>
        \nYou select a sphere\'s point of origin, and the sphere
        extends outward from that point. The sphere\'s
        size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends
        from the point.
        \n\tA sphere\'s point of origin is included in the sphere\'s
        area of effect.
    </string>

    <string name="saving_throws">
        Many spells specify that a target can make a saving
        throw to avoid some or all of a spell\'s effects. The spell
        specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and
        what happens on a success or failure.
        \n\tThe DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your
        spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus +
        any special modifiers.
    </string>

    <string name="attack_rolls">
        Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll
        to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended
        target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your
        spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.
        \n\tMost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged
        attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage
        on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile
        creature that can see you and that isn\'t incapacitated.
    </string>

    <string name="combining_magical_effects">
        The effects of different spells add together while
        the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of
        the same spell cast multiple times don\'t combine,
        however. Instead, the most potent effect - such as the
        highest bonus - from those castings applies while their durations overlap.
        \n\tFor example, if two clerics cast bless on the same
        target, that character gains the spell\'s benefit only
        once; he or she doesn\'t get to roll two bonus dice.
    </string>

    <string name="casting_in_armor">
        Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must
        be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted
        and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.
    </string>

    <string name="the_schools_of_magic">
        Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called
        schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these
        categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in
        essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous
        study or is bestowed by a deity.
        \n\tThe schools of magic help describe spells; they have no
        rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
        \n<b>Abjuration</b> spells are protective in nature, though some
        of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers,
        negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures
        to other planes of existence.
        \n<b>Conjuration</b> spells involve the transportation of objects
        and creatures from one location to another. Some spells
        summon creatures or objects to the caster\'s side, whereas
        others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some
        conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
        \n<b>Divination</b> spells reveal information, whether in the form of
        secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations
        of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of
        distant people or places.
        \n<b>Enchantment</b> spells affect lhe minds of others, influencing
        or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies
        see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of
        action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
        \n<b>Evocation</b> spells manipulate magical energy to produce a
        desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others
        channel positive energy to heal wounds.
        \n<b>Illusion</b> spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They
        cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things
        that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember
        things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom
        images that any creature can see, but the most insidious
        illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
        \n<b>Necromancy</b> spells manipulate the energies of life and
        death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force,
        drain the life energy from another creature, create the
        undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
        Creating the undead through lhe use of necromancy spells
        such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters
        use such spells frequently.
        \n<b>Transmutation</b> spells change the properties of a creature,
        object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a
        harmless creature. bolster the strength of an ally, make an
        object move at the caster\'s command, or enhance a creature\'s
        innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.

    <string name="the_weave_of_magic">
        The worlds within the D &amp; D multiverse are magical places.
        All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential
        energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living
        creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the stuff of
        creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating
        every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of
        energy throughout the multiverse.
        \n\tMortals can\'t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they
        make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between
        the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The
        spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and
        recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters
        have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. Sy
        any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and
        inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can\'t light a candle
        with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But
        surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning
        to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an
        eye, or even reverse death itself.
        \n\tAll magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds
        of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards,
        warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called <b>arcane
        magic</b>. These spells rely on an understanding - learned
        or intuitive - of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks
        directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired
        effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane
        magic. lhe spells of derics, druids, paladins, and rangers are
        called <b>divine magic</b>. These spellcasters\' access to the Weave
        is mediated by divine power - gods, the divine forces of
        nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin\'s oath.
        \n\tWhenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the
        Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible.
        When characters use divination spells such as <i>detect magic</i> or
        <i>identify</i>, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as <i>dispel magic</i>
        smooths the Weave. Spells such as <i>antimagic field</i> rearrange
        the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through,
        the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave
        is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways - or
        not at all.

        make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level
        for each spell on your list.
        \n\n<b>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</b>
        \nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard
        spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated
        study and memorization. You use your Intelligence
        whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
        In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when
        setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast
        and when making an attack roll with one.
        \n\t<b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
        \n\t<b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
        \n\n<b>RITUAL CASTING</b>
        \nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has
        the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook.
        You don\'t need to have the spell prepared.
        \n\n<b>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</b>
        \nYou can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting
        focus for your wizard spells.
        \n\n<b>LEARNING SPELLS OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</b>
        \nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two
        wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each
        of these spells must be of a level for which you have
        spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your
        adventures, you might find other spells that you can add
        to your spellbook (see the "Your Spellbook" sidebar).
        \n\n<b>YOUR SPELLBOOK</b>
        \nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels
        reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well
        as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature
        of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your
        adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in
        an evil wizard\'s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an
        ancient library.
        \n<i><b>Copying a Spell into the Book.</b></i> When you find a wizard spell
        of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is
        of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare
        the time to decipher and copy it.
        \n\tCopying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing
        the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique
        system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You
        must practice the spell until you understand the sounds
        or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook
        using your own notation.
        \n\tFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and
        costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you
        expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well
        as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent
        this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your
        other spells.
        \n<i><b>Replacing the Book.</b></i> You can copy a spell from your own
        spellbook into another book - for example, if you want
        to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like
        copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier,
        since you understand your own notation and already know
        how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp
        for each level of the copied spell.
        \n\tIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure
        to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new
        spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook
        requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this
        reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
        \n<i><b>The Book\'s Appearance.</b></i> Your spellbook is a unique
        compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and
        margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume
        that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound
        gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a
        loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost
        your previous spellbook in a mishap.
