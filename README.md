# SpellbookApp
An Android spellbook application for D&amp;D 5e. The current version is functional, though I will probably improve the UI/add some more features in the near future.

## Installation
To install the app on your phone, follow the instructions below:
- Go to the apk file in the Github repo, which is located [here](https://github.com/Carifio24/SpellbookApp/blob/master/Spellbook.apk)
- Select 'Desktop version', then 'Download'
- Install as prompted by Android. You may need to (temporarily) turn off some security settings, depending on your phone settings
