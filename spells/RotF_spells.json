        "desc": "While casting the spell, you place a vial of quicksilver in the chest of a life-sized human doll stuffed with ash or dust. You then stitch up the doll and drip your blood on it. At the end of the casting, you tap the doll with a crys­tal rod, transforming it into a magen clothed in whatever the doll was wearing. The type of magen is chosen by you during the casting of the spell. See the stat blocks below for different kinds of magen and their statistics.\nWhen the magen appears, your hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the magen's challenge rating (minimum reduction of 1). Only a wish spell can undo this reduction to your hit point maximum.\nAny magen you create with this spell obeys your com­mands without question.\n\n\nDEMOS MAGEN\nMedium construct, unaligned\n\nArmor Class: 16 (chain mail)\nHit Points: 51 (6d8 + 24)\nSpeed: 30 ft.\n\nSTR 14 (+2), DEX 14 (+2), CON 18 (+4)\nINT 10 (+0), WIS 10 (+0), CHA 7 (-2)\n\nDamage Immunities: poison\nCondition Immunities: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned\nSenses: passive Perception 10\nLanguages: understands the languages of its creator but can't speak\nChallenge 2 (450 XP)\n\nFiery End\nIf the magen dies, its body disintegrates in a harm­less burst of fire and smoke, leaving behind anything it was wearing or carrying.\n\nMagic Resistance\nThe magen has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\n\nUnusual Nature\nThe magen doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\nACTIONS\nMultiattack\nThe magen makes two melee attacks.\n\nGreatsword\nMelee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
